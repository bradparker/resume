I've been working as a web developer and designer for the past three years. I've been lucky enough to work up and down the stack with some really awesome people. We've written server applications in ruby and nodejs, we've written client-side applications in javascript, we've applied CSS to symantic markup.

I've also had the chance to drive development and domain / interface design for a product made in partnership with Red Hat. Here we we're able to solve tricky data mangement and workflow problems. In the process we hopefully made a heap of people's lives easier.
